TODO:

Small tasks:
- ***** test the view functions for each model (in tests.py) *****
- do something with the membership model (e.g. display when that user joined the group)
- could make a friendship through model to define friendship like membership
- block and report other users
- group suggestions


Plan:
- make a friend suggestion algorithm to learn how to make suggestions
    - also non-class related groups
- learn how to access the Umich course catalog via its API
- use the friend suggestion system as a basis for a class suggestion algorithm



Calendar:
- calendar for personal scheduling as well as group scheduling
- some way to track classes taken and work experiences over time (might not necessarily be a calendar)


CustomUser model:
- add more fields so it's a more complete profile (especially academic info, interests, etc.)
- make the profile page better


Messaging:
- messaging between friends 
- group messaging 
- messaging between friends


Groups:
- Make working boards and posts
    - NEXT UP: - nested posts / replies
    - upload different document types
- Make different permission levels so the creator can assign users to be group administrators
    - instead of just checking if the user is the creator of something, see if they have the permission
        - need to dynamically allocated permissions then -- group creator can edit / delete boards or posts, etc.
- use the membership model


Search:
- make a more advanced query system and display
- suggestions and autocomplete


Suggestion:
- priority is class suggestions to help students schedule
- also want suggested friends and groups
    - search bar and also other places


Authentication:
- legitemate email and password Authentication
    - only umich email


REST framework:
- begin implementing an API through the django REST framework
- use the API to create a reactive frontend (ReactJS probably) that works on mobile and web

Internal error handling:
- when something goes wrong with the code, it should recover not show a 404 or something
    - use try and catch statements (or whatever the python equivalent is)

Long term:
- analytics collection
