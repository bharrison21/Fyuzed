But how are these terms different? This course focuses on these various acts of mobility (travel) to show how they are labeled differently under different political and social circumstances. We examine the gendered cultural and political meanings people and governments give to mobility, border crossing, and displacement in this significant age of globalization, transnational mobility, and search of refuge. We will examine the meanings of travel and border crossing in relation to popular concepts such as ""refugee-ness"", ""diaspora,"" and ""transnationalism."" Have the meanings of these terms been useful in understanding the social constructions of gender identities, race, ethnicity, xenophobia, and even health and reproduction? We will particularly explore how questions of power, race, and class intersect to shape refugees and immigrants' daily struggles for justice and demands of inclusion in the rubrics of both national and transnational imagined communities. How do refugees and immigrants attempt to create and ""imagine"" their own social world with reference to their new locations and their homelands? And how their imaginations are interrupted by complex socio-economic and political realities? Our readings and discussion will focus on cultural and theoretical perspectives from the social sciences, specifically anthropology, history, literature, and political science. And we will take as examples the ethnographies and narratives of immigrants from different parts of the world, specifically Africa, the Middle East Asia, and Latin America.","['FA 2020 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2310&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=AAS&catalog=304', 'WN 2020 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2270&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=AAS&catalog=304', 'FA 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2260&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=AAS&catalog=304', 'WN 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2220&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=AAS&catalog=304']"

May not be repeated for credit.,"This senior/graduate seminar is an exploration in the anthropological approaches to the study of history and memory. It introduces and problematizes the concept of 'silence' in the ethnographic practices of history such as the silences of the empty archives, the ruptured oral historical accounts, and the fragments left behind by past events. Taking the demise of the Ottoman Empire as a starting point, the readings focus on minorities, refugees, and genocide survivors to probe into the history, historiography, and historicity that trace the lived experiences, mundane lives, and emotions of such marginal populations, underrepresented groups, undocumented individuals, and in-archived events. We take the creation of ethno-religious nation-states in the Middle East and the Balkans to navigate the following questions: How do we trace and represent the past in the aftermath of violence and destruction? How do historians and anthropologists conduct their research when the evidence is destroyed? Ultimately, what constitutes an 'evidence' for history, and how could we entertain material and immaterial remnants of the past to rethink our understanding of the 'archive'? Overall, the seminar invites participants to think of the role of historians and anthropologists as storytellers who are perpetually struggling with the politics of representation of the past. Second, we read ethnographies as genre of writing history with an eye on texts, research methods, and theories employed. The readings are anchored on the ethnography of Middle East and North Africa, with a comparative reference to the post-Ottoman Balkans. We take the Armenian genocide and the politics of its historiography, commemoration, and denial as a case study.",['FA 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2260&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=ANTHRCUL&catalog=430']

May not be repeated for credit.,"Before the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, Russian cinema genres resembled those common in Europe at the time. In the 1920s, however, Russian filmmakers, armed with bold new ideas about cinematic art and with a revolutionary political ideology, created theories of ""montage"" and a decade of acknowledged film masterpieces. In the 1930s, the experimental directions of early Soviet cinema were replaced by the doctrine of ""socialist realism,"" a style closer to that of classical (Hollywood) narrative cinema, with themes intended to foster the political and didactic agenda of the state. After Stalin's death in 1953, however, filmmakers were able to reintroduce personal and even religious and philosophical themes, as well as return to a more 'poetic' style, particularly in Ukrainian film. As censorship ended during the Gorbachev period of glasnost (openness), 1985-91, a more honest and naturalistic cinema emerged, along with renewed stylistic experimentation. In the 1990s and in the first decades of the 21st century Russian cinema has reacted to American-style genre films by adapting those patterns to deal with new pressing concerns, such as ethnic conflict and the economic traumas of the transition to capitalism. We will view, analyze and discuss fifteen films from the 1920s through the 2000s-with an eye both to their intrinsic artistic structure and to the social and cultural background and the political events with which they deal.",[]

""epidemics,"" from anti-vice crusades in the Progressive Era through the recent rise of mass incarceration under what critics label the American prison-industrial complex. The U.S. currently incarcerates around 2.3 million people, a higher percentage than any other nation in the world; counting probation and parole, more than 7 million Americans live under the supervision of the criminal justice system. At least 24 million Americans violate drug prohibition laws each month, primarily by smoking marijuana or the illicit use of pharmaceuticals; of the half million people imprisoned for nonviolent drug offenses, two-thirds are African American or Latino. This course will examine the deep historical roots of this contemporary landscape, especially the fuzzy and shifting boundaries between legality and illegality and the ways in which race, class, gender, and urban/suburban space have shaped policing practices, criminal justice enforcement, and media representations of criminality. Topics range from Mafia syndicates and Mexican cartels to the FBI and Big Pharma, from ""stop and frisk"" policing to the ""just say no"" campaign against teenage pot smoking, from immigration controls to the criminalization of political dissent, from crusades against juvenile delinquency to panics over kidnappers and sex offenders, from Attica and the prisoners' rights movement to racial controversies such as the Rockefeller Drug Laws, Central Park Five, and Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson.","['WN 2020 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2270&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=HISTORY&catalog=366', 'WN 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2220&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=HISTORY&catalog=366']"

"HISTORY 430 / ANTHRCUL 430 / MIDEAST 480. History, Memory, and Silence in the Middle East",(3). May not be repeated for credit.,"This senior/graduate seminar is an exploration in the anthropological approaches to the study of history and memory. It introduces and problematizes the concept of 'silence' in the ethnographic practices of history such as the silences of the empty archives, the ruptured oral historical accounts, and the fragments left behind by past events. Taking the demise of the Ottoman Empire as a starting point, the readings focus on minorities, refugees, and genocide survivors to probe into the history, historiography, and historicity that trace the lived experiences, mundane lives, and emotions of such marginal populations, underrepresented groups, undocumented individuals, and in-archived events. We take the creation of ethno-religious nation-states in the Middle East and the Balkans to navigate the following questions: How do we trace and represent the past in the aftermath of violence and destruction? How do historians and anthropologists conduct their research when the evidence is destroyed? Ultimately, what constitutes an 'evidence' for history, and how could we entertain material and immaterial remnants of the past to rethink our understanding of the 'archive'? Overall, the seminar invites participants to think of the role of historians and anthropologists as storytellers who are perpetually struggling with the politics of representation of the past. Second, we read ethnographies as genre of writing history with an eye on texts, research methods, and theories employed. The readings are anchored on the ethnography of Middle East and North Africa, with a comparative reference to the post-Ottoman Balkans. We take the Armenian genocide and the politics of its historiography, commemoration, and denial as a case study.",['FA 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2260&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=HISTORY&catalog=430']

Typology is concerned with broad statistical patterns, such as the relative frequencies of SVO and other word orders, but also with close analysis of extreme languages that push theoretical envelopes. When these outliers are considered, very few universals of linguistic form remain standing. Even the universal existence of syntactic phrases above word level is cast into doubt by radically nonconfigurational languages like Nunggubuyu. It is therefore necessary to test the entire gamut of grammatical categories and processes against crosslinguistic data. Lexical universals are also questionable; for example, some languages systematically lexicalize action verbs at the level of function/result, while others do so at the level of manner/process. Lexical and grammatical systems may also differ in how they relate to speaker/addressee sociolinguistic patterns.",[]

For all three areas of study, there is a common body of fundamentals. This class introduces those fundamentals. One focus is the processing pipeline involved in natural language understanding, particularly part of speech tagging, parsing, and semantic interpretation. A second focus is the extraction of linguistic information from text corpora; we will touch on collocations, language models, regular expressions, and text classification. The approach will be very hands-on. We will use the Natural Language Toolkit, in the Python programming language. The course does not assume prior experience with Python, nor does it assume a computer science background.

It introduces and problematizes the concept of 'silence' in the ethnographic practices of history such as the silences of the empty archives, the ruptured oral historical accounts, and the fragments left behind by past events. Taking the demise of the Ottoman Empire as a starting point, the readings focus on minorities, refugees, and genocide survivors to probe into the history, historiography, and historicity that trace the lived experiences, mundane lives, and emotions of such marginal populations, underrepresented groups, undocumented individuals, and in-archived events. We take the creation of ethno-religious nation-states in the Middle East and the Balkans to navigate the following questions: How do we trace and represent the past in the aftermath of violence and destruction? How do historians and anthropologists conduct their research when the evidence is destroyed? Ultimately, what constitutes an 'evidence' for history, and how could we entertain material and immaterial remnants of the past to rethink our understanding of the 'archive'? Overall, the seminar invites participants to think of the role of historians and anthropologists as storytellers who are perpetually struggling with the politics of representation of the past. Second, we read ethnographies as genre of writing history with an eye on texts, research methods, and theories employed. The readings are anchored on the ethnography of Middle East and North Africa, with a comparative reference to the post-Ottoman Balkans. We take the Armenian genocide and the politics of its historiography, commemoration, and denial as a case study.",['FA 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2260&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=MIDEAST&catalog=480']

One aim of the course is to combine humanistic and scientific ways of thinking, including through individual and collaborative writing projects that bring past and present understandings of addictive substances and behaviors into conversation. This approach is essential to grappling with the political, philosophical, and personal consequences of how we study and stigmatize particular ways of life. Our focus on crucial texts in the history of science and medicine means that we will engage with technical material from psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience, while our approach to this work will draw on methods from across the humanities.

One positive result of this was ample funding for serious films about social and political topics. In certain thematic areas, particularly those dealing with racial and ethnic intolerance and with the plight of women in patriarchal societies, filmmakers in East Central Europe were often able to be more incisive, frank and provocative than is often the case in profit-driven Hollywood film. Talented and committed filmmakers crafted powerful films which the regimes had no ideological grounds to suppress; this tradition of critical filmmaking has continued into the post-Communist period. The films we study concern the Holocaust, women's lives under state socialism, and the ethno-nationalism that led to the wars in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. We view and discuss fourteen films from East Central Europe dealing with the above issues, considering the artistic structure of the films as well.","['WN 2021 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2320&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=RCHUMS&catalog=312', 'FA 2020 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2310&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=RCHUMS&catalog=312', 'SP 2020 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2280&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=RCHUMS&catalog=312', 'WN 2020 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2270&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=RCHUMS&catalog=312', 'FA 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2260&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=RCHUMS&catalog=312', 'SP 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2230&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=RCHUMS&catalog=312', 'WN 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2220&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=RCHUMS&catalog=312', 'FA 2018 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2210&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=RCHUMS&catalog=312']"
RCHUMS 313 / FTVM 313 / SLAVIC 313. Russian and Ukrainian Cinema,(3). (HU). May not be repeated for credit. F.,"Before the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, Russian cinema genres resembled those common in Europe at the time. In the 1920s, however, Russian filmmakers, armed with bold new ideas about cinematic art and with a revolutionary political ideology, created theories of ""montage"" and a decade of acknowledged film masterpieces. In the 1930s, the experimental directions of early Soviet cinema were replaced by the doctrine of ""socialist realism,"" a style closer to that of classical (Hollywood) narrative cinema, with themes intended to foster the political and didactic agenda of the state. After Stalin's death in 1953, however, filmmakers were able to reintroduce personal and even religious and philosophical themes, as well as return to a more 'poetic' style, particularly in Ukrainian film. As censorship ended during the Gorbachev period of glasnost (openness), 1985-91, a more honest and naturalistic cinema emerged, along with renewed stylistic experimentation. In the 1990s and in the first decades of the 21st century Russian cinema has reacted to American-style genre films by adapting those patterns to deal with new pressing concerns, such as ethnic conflict and the economic traumas of the transition to capitalism. We will view, analyze and discuss fifteen films from the 1920s through the 2000s-with an eye both to their intrinsic artistic structure and to the social and cultural background and the political events with which they deal.",['FA 2018 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2210&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=RCHUMS&catalog=313']

Networks or graph representations describe the structure of connections among people and documents.  They permit mathematical analysis and meaningful visualizations that highlight different roles played by different people or documents, as well as features of the collection as a whole.  Game representations describe, in situations of interdependence, the actions available to different people and how each person's outcomes are contingent on the choices of other people.  It permits analysis of stable sets of choices by all the people (equilibrium's).

SLAVIC 312 / RCHUMS 312. Central European Cinema,A knowledge of Russian is not required. (3). (HU). (R&E). May not be repeated for credit. Taught in English.,"During four decades of Communist Party rule, the film industries of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the former Yugoslavia were under state control. One positive result of this was ample funding for serious films about social and political topics. In certain thematic areas, particularly those dealing with racial and ethnic intolerance and with the plight of women in patriarchal societies, filmmakers in East Central Europe were often able to be more incisive, frank and provocative than is often the case in profit-driven Hollywood film. Talented and committed filmmakers crafted powerful films which the regimes had no ideological grounds to suppress; this tradition of critical filmmaking has continued into the post-Communist period. The films we study concern the Holocaust, women's lives under state socialism, and the ethno-nationalism that led to the wars in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. We view and discuss fourteen films from East Central Europe dealing with the above issues, considering the artistic structure of the films as well.","['WN 2021 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2320&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=SLAVIC&catalog=312', 'FA 2020 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2310&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=SLAVIC&catalog=312', 'SP 2020 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2280&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=SLAVIC&catalog=312', 'WN 2020 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2270&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=SLAVIC&catalog=312', 'FA 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2260&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=SLAVIC&catalog=312', 'SP 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2230&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=SLAVIC&catalog=312', 'WN 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2220&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=SLAVIC&catalog=312', 'FA 2018 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2210&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=SLAVIC&catalog=312']"
SLAVIC 313 / FTVM 313 / RCHUMS 313. Russian and Ukrainian Cinema,(3). (HU). May not be repeated for credit. F.,"Before the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, Russian cinema genres resembled those common in Europe at the time. In the 1920s, however, Russian filmmakers, armed with bold new ideas about cinematic art and with a revolutionary political ideology, created theories of ""montage"" and a decade of acknowledged film masterpieces. In the 1930s, the experimental directions of early Soviet cinema were replaced by the doctrine of ""socialist realism,"" a style closer to that of classical (Hollywood) narrative cinema, with themes intended to foster the political and didactic agenda of the state. After Stalin's death in 1953, however, filmmakers were able to reintroduce personal and even religious and philosophical themes, as well as return to a more 'poetic' style, particularly in Ukrainian film. As censorship ended during the Gorbachev period of glasnost (openness), 1985-91, a more honest and naturalistic cinema emerged, along with renewed stylistic experimentation. In the 1990s and in the first decades of the 21st century Russian cinema has reacted to American-style genre films by adapting those patterns to deal with new pressing concerns, such as ethnic conflict and the economic traumas of the transition to capitalism. We will view, analyze and discuss fifteen films from the 1920s through the 2000s-with an eye both to their intrinsic artistic structure and to the social and cultural background and the political events with which they deal.",['FA 2018 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2210&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=SLAVIC&catalog=313']

Because all of us make sense of texts and issues in a variety of ways, this course will ask students to utilize multimodal (visual, aural, kinetic, etc.) forms of communication and become more informed and critical consumers of digital and social media writing themselves.","['WN 2021 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2320&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=WRITING&catalog=200', 'FA 2020 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2310&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=WRITING&catalog=200', 'WN 2020 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2270&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=WRITING&catalog=200', 'FA 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2260&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=WRITING&catalog=200', 'WN 2019 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2220&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=WRITING&catalog=200', 'FA 2018 - http://www.lsa.umich.edu/cg/cg_results.aspx?termArray=x_xx_2210&cgtype=ug&show=20&department=WRITING&catalog=200']"
